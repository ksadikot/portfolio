In this role I was able to work with senior developers and assist them on their tasks ranging from back-end to front-end and gain knowledge and hands on experience working with technologies such as ASP.NET, Java, SQL, as well as front-end frameworks such as node, Vuejs and typescript. </p>\r\n                                        </Col>\r\n                                    </Row>\r\n                                    <Row>\r\n                                    <Col>\r\n                                        <p>My most noteworthy project assigned to me was to implement a pagination support component that would replace the current method of displaying user orders which had many limitations. This task required me to work on both front-end as well as back-end to create an elegant solution. I was required to make changes as well as enhance API endpoints by integrating OData to GET requests allowing me to build queries on the fly without extra API calls. Using OData I would filter the data according to each page and display the relevant order data on corresponding page numbers. using Vuetify components to create a pagination support on the front-end that allowed users to flip through pages. This was a very valuable project as I was required to make significant changes to both front-end as well as back-end code, allowing me to gain the technical skills needed to become a proficient full-stack developer.</p>\r\n                                    </Col>\r\n                                    </Row>\r\n                                    <Row>\r\n                                    <Col>\r\n                                        <p>I plan to use these skills in my future terms and experiences only to build on the knowledge I have gained working at Molex.

The pandemic brought much change to the world and one of those changes was a need for companies to grow their online presence, and the University wasn’t an exception. Student Recruitment thrives on student interaction and the first rule the pandemic taught us was to distance ourselves from others, in a normal year members of Student Recruitment would be a part of the Ontario University Fair, visiting highschools around the province and country but all that had to stop. This is where my role comes in.</p>\r\n                                        </Col>\r\n                                    </Row>\r\n                                    <Row >\r\n                                        <Col>\r\n                                            <p>The main projects I worked on in this role was the development of event websites the University hosted to generate student leads.

Future employers can hope to gain someone proficient in JavaScript and its frameworks, but also someone eager to learn and willing to do anything in the pursuit of achieving their goals.\r\n                                            </p>\r\n                                        </Col>\r\n                                    </Row>\r\n                                </Container>\r\n                            </Card.Body>\r\n                        </Accordion.Collapse>\r\n                    </Card>\r\n\r\n\r\n                </Accordion>\r\n            </Container>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n    );\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default HomePage;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Container, Row, Col } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\nfunction Content(props) {\r\n    return(\r\n\r\n        <Container fluid>\r\n            <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n                <Col  md={8}>\r\n                    {props.children}\r\n                </Col>\r\n            </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Content","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/AbMeimg.0d0f2c73.jpg\";","import React from 'react';\r\nimport Content from '../components/Content';\r\nimport Hero from '../components/Hero';\r\nimport AbMeimg from '../AbMeimg.jpg'\r\nimport { Container, Row, Col } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\nfunction AboutPage(props) {\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n\r\n        <div>\r\n            <Hero title={props.title} />\r\n\r\n            <Content>\r\n            Hi I’m Kaid Sadikot, a current Computer Science major at the University of Guelph. I am in my 3rd year at the university and am looking for a 2021 summer co-op opportunity. My passion for development began in my 2nd year at the university, some might consider that late but coming into my 1st year like many others I was unsure of my path and had no real drive in my field of study. It was then after 1 year of programming and entering my 2nd year where the challenges I faced in my classes began to become an obsession, where instead of thinking about lifes infinite questions in the shower I was thinking about how to fix the infinite loop in my program. Thus began my passion for coding and developing applications that would challenge me. Currently I have focused myself on Front-end development learning the intricacies of javaScript and beginning my journey as a React Developer. I strive to bring dedication and a willingness to learn in any role I take. My development journey has just begun and I hope to make a real impact in my future career as a developer.\r\n            </Content>\r\n\r\n            <br/>\r\n\r\n            <Container fluid=\"lg w-50\" >\r\n                <Row className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n                    <Col md={8} sm={12}>\r\n                        <img src={AbMeimg} className=\"img-fluid img-thumbnail\"  alt=\"About me image\" />\r\n                    </Col>\r\n                </Row>\r\n            </Container>\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default AboutPage;","import React from 'react'\nimport { Container, Nav, Navbar } from 'react-bootstrap';\nimport {\n  BrowserRouter as Router,\n  Route,\n  Link\n} from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport './App.css';\n\nimport Footer from './components/Footer';\nimport HomePage from './pages/HomePage';\nimport AboutPage from './pages/AboutPage';\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      title: 'Kaid Sadikot',\n      headerLinks: [\n        { title: 'Home', path: '/' },\n        { title: 'Aout', path: '/about' }\n      ],\n      home: {\n        title: 'Welcome to my website',\n        subtitle: 'This is what I\\'ve done'\n      },\n      about: {\n        title: 'About Me'\n      }\n\n    }\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Router>\n        <Container className=\"p-0\" fluid>\n\n          <Navbar className=\"border-bottom\" bg=\"transparent\" expand=\"lg\">\n            <Navbar.Brand>Kaid Sadikot</Navbar.Brand>\n\n            <Navbar.Toggle className=\"border-0\" aria-controls=\"navbar-toggle\" />\n            <Navbar.Collapse id=\"navbar-toggle\">\n              <Nav className=\"ms-auto\">\n                <Link className=\"nav-link\" to=\"/\">Home</Link>\n                <Link className=\"nav-link\" to=\"/about\">About</Link>\n                \n              </Nav>\n            </Navbar.Collapse>\n          </Navbar>\n\n          <Route path=\"/\" exact render={() => <HomePage title={this.state.home.title} subtitle={this.state.home.subtitle} />} />\n          <Route path=\"/about\" exact render={() => <AboutPage title={this.state.about.title} />} />\n\n          <Footer/>\n        </Container>\n\n        \n      </Router>\n    );\n  }\n\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.

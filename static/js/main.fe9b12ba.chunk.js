It was then after 1 year of programming and entering my 2nd year where the challenges I faced in my classes began to become an obsession, where instead of thinking about lifes infinite questions in the shower I was thinking about how to fix the infinite loop in my program. Thus began my passion for coding and developing applications that would challenge me. Currently I have focused myself on Front-end development learning the intricacies of javaScript and beginning my journey as a React Developer.
